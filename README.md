# SMS Spam Detection using AI/ML

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting spam messages in SMS (Short Message Service) conversations. With the increasing volume of spam messages being sent through SMS, this tool provides a solution for automatically identifying and filtering out such unwanted messages.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build effective classifiers for spam detection.
  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures the performance of the models using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, support and F1-score to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available SMS spam dataset, containing labeled SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham), for training and evaluation purposes.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the SMS dataset using the provided scripts or notebooks.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data and experiment with different algorithms and parameters.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using cross-validation or holdout validation techniques to assess their performance.
